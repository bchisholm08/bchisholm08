Hello! My name is Brady, and I'm an undergraduate student at University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities. I am a Psychology major, with a Computer Science minor. 

Currently working in the Auditory Perception and Cognition Lab with Professor Andrew Oxenham, working on research related to speech and listening effort.

I love being outside, reading, and playing with my kitten, Poppy!
